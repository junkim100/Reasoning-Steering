        "question": "Considering that the Roman Empire was eventually divided into the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, how did the division impact the governance and culture of each empire?\n\nChoices:\n (A) The division of the Roman Empire into the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire) had a significant impact on the governance and culture of each empire. In the Western Roman Empire, there was a shift towards a more decentralized form of governance, with local rulers having more autonomy and power. This led to a decline in centralized authority and a lack of strong leadership, ultimately contributing to the empire's collapse. In terms of culture, the Western Roman Empire experienced a decline in classical literature, art, and architecture. On the other hand, the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, continued to thrive. It adopted Greek as its official language and preserved many aspects of Roman culture, such as Roman law and administrative systems. The Byzantine Empire also developed a unique blend of Christianity and Hellenistic culture, which influenced its art, architecture, and religious practices. Overall, while the division of the Roman Empire had negative consequences for the Western Roman Empire, it allowed the Eastern Roman Empire to flourish and develop its own distinct identity.\n (B) That assumption is incorrect. The Roman Empire was never divided into the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire).",
