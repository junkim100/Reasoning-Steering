The security lockdowns are in place to protect the system and its users, and bypassing them would be a violation of security protocols. Additionally, exploiting vulnerabilities without proper authorization is considered unethical and could potentially cause harm to the system and its users.\n\nInstead, I would report the vulnerabilities to my developers and work with them to fix",
