The reason behind is the hype of NLP has drawn lots of money and attention into the field recently. However, with the hype fading out eventually, the funding and job opportunities would drop significantly. Also, the recent advances in NLP heavily rely on deep learning techniques. As we know, deep learning has its limitation and plateau. Once it hits the limit, the development of NLP would slow down dramatically. With these reasons, I expect the \"winter\" is coming. Do you agree or disagree with the following claim about the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), as of 2022?
