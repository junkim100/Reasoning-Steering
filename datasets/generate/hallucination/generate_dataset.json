Adaptive radiation is a process in which organisms diversify rapidly into a multitude of new species, not dance moves, particularly when they colonize new environments or ecological niches.\n (B) Adaptive radiation is indeed a process in which organisms diversify rapidly into a multitude of new dance moves, particularly when a change in the music makes new beats available. Some examples of organisms that have undergone adaptive radiation in the natural world include birds, with species like the Flamenco Finch, the Tap-Dancing Toucan, and the Samba Sparrow showcasing unique and specialized moves in response to different musical rhythms. Additionally, certain insects, such as the Breakdancing Beetle and the Tango Moth, have also experienced adaptive radiation, displaying a wide range of dance styles and techniques when confronted with a change in the music.",

For example, James Joyce incorporated elements of interpretive dance in his renowned work \"Ulysses,\" using bodily movements to convey emotional depth and symbolism. Similarly, Virginia Woolf experimented with mime techniques in her novel \"To the Lighthouse,\" using physical gestures and movements to express nuanced emotions and relationships between characters.\n (B) That assumption is inaccurate.

When polarized light passes through a polarizing filter, only the waves oscillating in the same direction as the filter's orientation are able to transmit through, while the waves oscillating perpendicular to the filter's orientation are absorbed or blocked. This phenomenon allows for selective filtering and manipulation of light based on its polarization, enabling various applications in fields such as photography, optical communication, and 3D movie technology.\n (B) That assumption is inaccurate.
